    "## Conditional Statements \n",
    "- When a conditional statement is used, it is used to determine if a statement is true or false. Then depending on the outcome of the statement, the program will run a certain way. There are three different conditional statements within python `if`, `elif`, and `else`. The `if` statement is used to determine if a statement is true or false. The `elif` statement is used to determine if the previous statement was false and if the current statement is true. The `else` statement is used to determine if the previous statement was false and if the current statement is false. Seen bellow in code segments from in class. "
